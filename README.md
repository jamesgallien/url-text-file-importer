# url-text-file-importer

Problem: I've got a whole bunch of old text files with URLs I wanted to save. Yeah so back then I just copied and pasted them into a handful of text files. Stop laughing.

Solution: Anyways, so this is a little project to grab all that stuff, put it into a database, and render it in HTML. Nothing too earth-shattering. I might develop it further as I have time and inspiration.

Technologies: Python, Flask, SQLite, Bootstrap

Setup:

- clone
- set up a venv
- pip install requirements.txt
- `flask run`
